Here are five action steps to consider to actualize your 2023:</h3>
  <ol type="1"><li> Conduct an honest self-assessment.
  
  This is where the real work starts that separates “leaders from managers” and “first quintiler from fourth quintiler.” It is difficult because you must force yourself to look in the mirror, not out the window. When you look out the window, you can convince yourself that others are responsible for failure or friction. To unlock greatness, you need to look in the mirror both personally and professionally.

  Over the years, we have discussed “active listening.” Active listening entails a deep understanding of the wants, needs, desires and dreams of others. We often look out the window and position what we want a candidate to hear or see, instead of understanding what drives and motivates an ideal hire.
  
  
  How did you do with active listening in 2022? What will you change to improve in 2023? The only way to accelerate your results is to look in the mirror and evaluate critical topics, like active listening.</li>
  <br>
  <li> Evaluate what worked and what did not work.
  This is an exercise in sweat equity that most only complete halfway. We enjoy creating a T-chart on the left for what worked in 2022, but we procrastinate on the right side: what didn’t work in 2022.
  
  What will be the critical drivers for your success in 2023? Active listening, team engagement, reducing friction, improving processes, better messaging, more community involvement, embracing diversity and valuing alternative opinions are all great examples.
  
  What didn’t work in 2022 that you can modify and evolve for success in 2023? This work is on you, and no one else. It is your responsibility.</li><br>
  
  <li>Empower others.
  
  We know a lot of people who have to “do it my way” as they have always done it, whether right or wrong. We know people who want to win—and want all the credit. Both concepts lead to continued underperformance. It may not be underperformance to your corporate goals as much as it’s underperformance to your potential. The most successful and compelling leaders understand the concept of leverage and provide recognition early and often.
  
  Focus on giving away all the credit in 2023, and see how much rains back on you. Now that you have identified the right side of your T-chart of what didn’t work, consider whether this is due to having to do it “your way” versus an evolved way. All of us have a little “control freak” in us. That control holds us back and limits our potential and the potential of our teams.
  
  Consider taking the monumental leap and giving up control by empowering others to leverage the team’s results. It is uncomfortable, and you will likely have an impulse to short-term it and say it didn’t work, so you go back to “my way.” Avoid that temptation and embrace your uncomfortableness.</li><br>
  
 <li> Be a partner—vendors are a dime a dozen.
  In the financial services industry, like many industries, you work with external partners and external vendors. In the external search firm business, our firm works with a few partners and we are weeding out the vendors. The vendors send us candidates that they send to multiple firms and at times use us to get the highest bid or the highest compensation for the vendor firm. They really have no long-term interest in our success: They throw stuff against the wall and hope we win to get them paid.
  
  
  Conversely, partners have a relationship with their candidates and want to land them in the most appropriate firm to the benefit of that candidate. When a partner search firm sends us a lead, we are confident our firm is the right firm and we are not being disintermediated like the vendor.
  
  Assess which firms are partners and which firms are vendors. Cut your vendors, and invest in your partners. You owe a vendor nothing. Let them sell themselves to the highest bidder because intelligent candidates will spot the difference between a partner and a vendor and understand a vendor cares more about the check than them.</li><br>
  
 <li> Really plan long-term.
  Every firm wants more results that are more predictable and at a lower cost. That’s not how the world wants to work. Results are lumpy and unpredictable. That’s how the world actually works. You can clearly try to level out results, but to what end? When you try to bake in predictability, you lower the potential of your results because you drive to be easier and more predictable, which ultimately results in smaller. Smaller recruits, smaller assets, smaller production—you name your “smaller.”
  
  How can you combat the need for level results? Plan strategically for the long term and execute tactically in the short term. Have a strategic plan that is long-term focused with a short-term tactical plan to execute. Commit to both plans. What you will learn is that the results may be "lumpy," but the lumpiness gets larger. While nothing is ever even or goes completely smoothly, you can look back in a few years and see that the strategic plan allowed green shoots to become trees, and your results grow beyond the expectations of others.</li></ol>
